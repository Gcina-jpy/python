# python
what is python ?
python is a high-level, interpreted programing language known for its easy-to-read syntax and powerful capabilities 
you run the script using the command "python example.py" 

indentation - refers to the spaces/tabs to define blocks of code. 

variables and data types: 
python variables dont require explicit declaration and can store diffrent types of data, such as integers,floats, strings

comments : use the # symbol for commments 

control flow:
learn how to use if,else,elif and loops (For,while) to control the flow of your program 

functions : are blocks of reusable code, define 

Variables in python: 
you dont need to explicitly declare a variable or its data type before using it, you simply assign a value to a variable using the = operator 

E.G age = 25 
name = "Alice"

-naming rules : variables names must start with a letter or an _
-they can contain letters,numbers and underscores but cannot start with a number
- variables are case sensitive (Name and name are diffrent)

DATA TYPES:

integer(int):  - represents whole numbers without a decimal point. 

E.G age = 30 

floating -point number(float): 
-represents numbers with a decimal point 

E.G height = 5.9 

string(str): 
represents sequences of characters enclosed in quotes(single or double) 

E.G name = "Alice"

Boolean(bool): 
represents one or two values: True or false  
is_student = True 

Compound data types : 

list(list): 
an ordered collection of items that can contain elements of diffrent data types. lists are mutable,meaning their contents can be changed.
e.g fruits["apple","banana","cherry"}

tuple(tuple): 
similar to lists but tubles are immutable, once created their contents cannot be changed. 
example: coordinates =(10.0, 20.0)

Dictionary(dict): 
collection of key-value pairs. each key must be unique ,and values can be of any data type. 
E.g person ={"name":"alice","age":25}

Set(set): 
an unordered collection of unique elements. 
unique_numbers ={1,2,3,4,5}

type conversion: 
implicit type conversion : 
- python automatically converts one data type to another when necesary. for example, adding an integer to a float results in float 
result = 10 + 3.5 #13.5 (float)

Explicit type conversion: 
you can manually convert a data type to another using functions like int(),float(),str() and list()
example : num_str="100"
num_int = int(num_str)  # converts string to integer 

type checking: 
use the type() function to check the data type of a variable

example: print(type(age))

Operators and expressions:
- operators and expressions are fundamental concepts in python that allow you to perform various operations on data. 

operators- are special symbols or keywords in python that perform operations on variables and values. for example + is an operator used for addition 
 
expressions: 
- an expression is a combination of values,variables and operators that python  interprets and evaluates to produce a result. for example 2+3 IS A Expression that evalutes to 5
